- Figure out partial rehydration
- Re-add `script` to SSR for micro frontend. Make sure it doesn't execute `assetsManifestLocation`. Maybe use a custom hook?
- Fix hot-reloading.
- Return `renderToString` before `ReactRenderTarget` potentially.
- Composition of custom routes.
- Render more than one micro frontend using `MicroFrontendContext`.
- Grab main `server.bundle.js` from CDN.
- Clear `require.cache` when new version is available from CDN.
- Figure out how to fix Node.js version conflicts (spawn child renderer for micro frontends?)
- When micro frontend renders SSR, it has the capability of forcing a redirect if the shell doesn't.
